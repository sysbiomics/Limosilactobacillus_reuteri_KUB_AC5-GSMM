# Limosilactobacillus_reuteri_KUB_AC5-GSMM
A high quality genome-scale metabolic model of probiotic _L. reuteri_ KUB-AC5

- Brief Repository Description

This repository contains a genome-scale metabolic model **iTN656** for _Limosilactobacillus reuteri_ KUB-AC5.

- Abstract:
_Limosilactobacillus reuteri_ KUB-AC5 displays the hallmark features of probiotic properties for food and feed industries. Optimization of cultivation condition for the industrial production is important to reach cell concentration and cost reduction. Considering the strain-specific growth physiology, metabolic capability and essential nutrients of _L. reuteri_ KUB-AC5, the genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of _L. reuteri_ KUB-AC5 was developed. Hereby, the GSMM of **iTN656** was successfully constructed which contained 656 genes, 831 metabolites, and 953 metabolic reactions. The iTN656 model could show a metabolic capability under various carbon sources and guide potentially 14 essential single nutrients (e.g., vitamin B complex and amino acids) and 2 essential double nutrients (pairwise glutamine-glutamate and asparagine-aspartate) for _L. reuteri_ KUB-AC5 growth through single and double omission analysis. Promisingly, the iTN656 model was further integrated with transcriptome data suggesting that putative metabolic routes as preferable paths e.g., sucrose uptake, nucleotide biosynthesis, urea cycle and glutamine transporter for _L. reuteri_ KUB-AC5 growth. The developed GSMM offers a powerful tool for multi-level omics analysis, enabling probiotic strain optimization for biomass overproduction in industrial scale.
